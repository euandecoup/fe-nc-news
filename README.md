## Summary

This project is the frontend version of the Northcoders News API project. It is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The application provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the data served by the Northcoders News API.

Users can view articles, post comments, and vote on both articles and comments. The frontend communicates with the backend API to fetch the necessary data and also to post new data or updates.
